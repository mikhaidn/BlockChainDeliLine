# BlockChainDeliLine
Take your ticket, and you'll be serviced when your number is next!

Catalyst: nft.gamestop.com (nfteam@gamestop.com) 

Goal:
Create a proof of concept webapp to allow visitors to "take an NFT ticket" and be notified when it's their turn in line

This can be used for online ticket purchases, or for people who want to provide a platform for companies/individuals to reach out and verify that they have examined a (my) profile, and allow the profile owner the opportunity to know when their profile was visited (a la LinkedIn)

Technology Requirements:
Solidity. React, Python

User Stories:
* A visitor to this webapp must beable to recieve a NFT Ticket and clearly understand:
    * Where they lay in line
    * What to do next when it is their turn
    * What happens if they don't respond in time
* A profile owner must be able to:
    * View their NFT tickets, and basic contact information related to them
    * Request the top ticket from a queue
    * Establish a "respond by T-x" constraint on ticketholders
    * Send a ticket to the back of the line or remove it from the queue entirely

Current Todo:
Install Solidity, react, python
- Refresher on react/python interactions
- Understand the TL;DR of Solidity, the Etherium blockchain, and "know what I need to know" for the MVP of this project

Pseudostructured Changelog:
May 26th - Project initialization, establish tech requirements/constraints, and establish ideal User Stories
